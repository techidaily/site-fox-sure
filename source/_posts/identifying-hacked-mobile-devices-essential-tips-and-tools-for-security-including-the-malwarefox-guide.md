Do you ever feel like you’re not the only one who knows about your recent late-night pizza binge or that secret rendezvous last weekend? Is your smartphone acting like it has a mind of its own? You may not be paranoid. It’s entirely possible that your phone is being monitored. But don’t fret! We’ve got your back. Here, we’ll discuss quick codes, also known as USSD codes, which can help you detect if your phone has been hacked.

## USSD Codes to Check if Phone is being Tracked

Think of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes as a secret language that your phone understands. These codes reveal hidden phone settings and using them is as easy as dialing a few digits and symbols. Like entering a secret password, your phone instantly responds to these codes, providing you with the information you need.

### The IMEI Code: Your Phone’s Unique Identity Card

Let’s start with the first code: \*#06#. Dialing this code will reveal your phone’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique 15-digit number that’s like a fingerprint for your phone. While this code won’t directly tell you if your phone has been hacked, it will be handy to have this unique identifier in case you need to file a complaint or track your device.

### Call Forwarding Codes: Unveiling the Intruders

Ever felt like your calls and messages are landing somewhere they shouldn’t be? Hackers can set up call forwarding to redirect your incoming calls and SMS to another number. A quick dial of \*#61# can help you check if this unwelcome redirection is happening. If it is, you can use the same code to remove the forwarding. 

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Call-Forwarding-Status.webp "Call-Forwarding-Status")

But who’s on the other end of these redirected calls and messages? Dialing \*#62# can help you answer this question. If this code returns a number, don’t panic. It could just be your voicemail. If not, dial ##62# to disable the forwarding and wave goodbye to the intrusive hackers.

For a more thorough check on conditional call forwarding, you can dial \*#004#. This code reveals the destination of your redirected calls or messages under various conditions – when you’re unreachable, on another call, or when a call is rejected or unanswered. And if you want to disable all types of call forwarding, dial ##002#.

### Code to Check if Phone is Tapped

Some hackers may opt for a more covert tactic — unconditional data forwarding. This technique redirects all your calls and messages without your phone even ringing. Dial \*#21# to check if your phone is under such a stealth attack. If it is, dial ##21# to wipe out these suspicious settings.

### The Tracking Codes: Are You Being Watched?

Your phone’s location can also be a target for hackers. Android users can dial \*#\*#4636#\*#\* or \*#\*#197328640#\*#\* to check if they’re being monitored. iPhone users can enter \*3001#12345#\* to launch the Field Test app. This app provides detailed information about your phone’s signal and connection and can indicate if your movements are being tracked.

## Protect your Phone against Hackers

Manually removing threats may be a time-consuming and difficult task that needs expert-level computer knowledge. So, we recommend professional antivirus program like TotalAV which can detect and remove all traces of virus infection. It can finish the task for you in just one click.

[Download TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

While these codes can reveal a wealth of information, they can’t detect everything. Sophisticated hackers can install spyware that these codes won’t pick up. So, what’s the solution? Arm yourself with a reliable [anti-malware tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) which not only can detect threats, but also provide comprehensive protection against them.

Remember, your phone is like an extension of your personal space. You wouldn’t hand over your house keys to a stranger, and the same caution should apply to your phone. Stay vigilant, stay safe.
