## What is Jigsaw Ransomware?

The Jigsaw ransomware is a Windows-based ransomware that first came into notice in 2016\. Also known as the Bitcoin Blackmailer, this ransomware is known to blackmail its target victims in exchange for a good sum of money. Since 2016, many new variants of the Jigsaw ransomware have been seen.

The main agenda of this ransomware is similar to any other virus or malware, i.e. to yield a heavy amount from the victims. Although, this ransomware adopts a somewhat different approach to achieve its goals. 

Inspired by the horror movie named Saw, the Jigsaw ransomware encrypts the entire data of the victim’s computer through the AES encryption technique. In exchange for the user’s sensitive data, the attacker then demands a bitcoin equivalent to $150 before the countdown timer ends, which was started as soon as the files were encrypted. If the demanded amount is not paid within the time limit, one file is deleted, followed by another one after the second countdown ends. As time passes, this ransomware keeps on deleting sensitive files from the system.

This ransomware is known to be able to encrypt around 226 types of files, and therefore no data can escape its traps. This is how it lays its hands on a vulnerable system.

## How did I Get Infected?

One of the most prominent ways through which the Jigsaw ransomware is known to enter a system is through spam emails. The attackers aim at a wide range of audiences to whom a fraud or spam email is sent. Usually, the Jigsaw virus is sent as an attachment with these spam emails. 

As soon as the victim opens the attachment in the email, the ransomware is automatically installed in the system. The Jigsaw ransomware often hides under the name of files like “firefox.exe” or “drpbx.exe”. Once the file is opened, the ransomware itself writes a launching code for itself and makes a smooth path to enter the system.

While spam emails are the most common ways through which the Jigsaw ransomware attacks a system, many of its variants can also be found on Adware and inauthentic websites. Thus, if you have installed a random file through email or through an unknown website, it could be the reason behind your system getting infected by the Jigsaw ransomware.

## How to Remove the Jigsaw Ransomware?

Manually removing threats may be a time-consuming and difficult task that needs expert-level computer knowledge. So, we recommend professional antivirus program like TotalAV which can detect and remove all traces of virus infection. It can finish the task for you in just one click.

While a lot of users try to reboot their system, hoping to get rid of the virus, it only starts up the ransomware again to delete another 1000 files. Although, the ransomware has a loophole that makes it easy to get rid of this ransomware. While the ransomware warns the victim that 1000 files from the system will be deleted if the victim tries to get rid of the ransom, this is not true. 

To manually remove the Jigsaw ransomware from your system, you must follow the below steps.

* On your system, open the Task Manager through the “Ctrl+Shift+Esc” key combination.

* In the task manager, right-click on the “Firefox” and “Dropbox” options and select the “End task” option. This will end the ransomware functioning in your system.

* Now, to prevent the ransomware from getting restarted again, open the “Startup” tab in the task manager.

* Again select the “Firefox” and “Dropbox” options and disable them. This will prevent the ransomware from restarting again once the system is restarted.
* Download the “Checkpoint Jigsaw Puzzle Solver” from the internet and unzip the JPS.zip file.
* Run the file as administrator and follow the steps it guides you through to uninstall the Jigsaw ransomware successfully.
* That’s it. You have successfully protected your system against the Jigsaw ransomware.

What the “Checkpoint Jigsaw Puzzle Solver” file does is that it tricks the ransomware into thinking the victim has successfully paid for the ransom. As a result, this will decrypt all your sensitive files and help you to recover your data back.
